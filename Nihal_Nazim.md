# About Me
- Hi my name is Nihal "Nick" Nazim, I am currently a second semester sophomore student.
- Some of my hobbies include listening to music, working out, gaming and spending time with my girlfriend.
- My career interests include becoming either a mechanical or aerospace engineer. I currently work as a robotics mentor under Adelphi's S.T.E.P. program.


# My Prior Experience Coding
- My prior coding experience includes utilizing python and C within the project lab. Additionally I have experience with python, html, java and javascript from my highschool classes and private learning. However I have long since forgotten the majority of all of those languages.


# What Am I Interested in Learning This Semester?
- Over the course of this semester I'm interested in learning about making simulations.


# My Opinions of L.L.M.s
- Personally I am of the opinion that it needs significant refinement for it to be viable in the long run. However as it is right now it is a decent source to find information at a relative ease, with the given caveat that the commands need to be simple or very detailed and the subject needs to be well known. Otherwise a series of mishaps will occur and you'll be presented with a false answer that the L.L.M. fully supported.
